# Leaseweb API-Definitions
This repository contains the source code for Leaseweb API specifications. The Leaseweb API allows developers to manage and automate various services provided by Leaseweb, such as server infrastructure, cloud solutions, and network management. 

### Issues
If you encounter an issue with the project, you are welcome to submit an [issue](https://github.com/Leaseweb/API-Definitions/issues).

### Pull requests
We ask that an issue is always opened prior to a PR to give us the opportunity to discuss the best place for the change before investing your effort on a patch that we may not be able to accept.

The code in the repository is generated from the OpenAPI specification. This means PRs to code, tests and sometimes even markdown are often inappropriate and we may need to make changes to the specification instead.
